# 🐣 Why SLMs? 2/2
## Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI
> https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/
- **Small language models (SLMs)** are **powerful enough** for many agentic AI applications, being **more cost-effective** and **better suited** than large language models (LLMs).
- The recommendation is to use **SLMs for routine tasks**, keep LLMs for complex reasoning, and design modular agent systems.
- This approach lowers latency, reduces energy consumption, and speeds up **adaptation to new requirements**.
