# Challenges 
> to use SMLs with less but more appropriate/accurate context

- Provide **smaller context**: Efficiency, Speed, Cost
- Keep the context relevant: <span class="indianred">**Better focus**</span> on the topic -> <span class="dodgerblue">**Better answers**</span>
- Be able to retrieve all the releated information
- Keep only a **small number of messages** (history)
